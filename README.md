PROBLEM STATEMENT

Turning CCTV into silent guardians of mental health. Mental health crises don‚Äôt wait. Yet, in schools, offices, and public spaces, sadness often slips through unnoticed ‚Äî even under the constant gaze of surveillance cameras. Today's systems see motion, not emotion. The challenge? Build tech that detects emotional distress in real time, connects people to support systems without breaching their privacy, and turns passive monitoring into proactive care.

‚úÖ APPROACH

We aim to enhance traditional CCTV systems with the capability to detect emotional distress, particularly sadness, and trigger timely, appropriate responses ‚Äî all while respecting privacy and context.
1)Emotion Detection Use real-time video feeds from existing CCTV cameras to detect facial expressions using computer vision and deep learning models trained on emotion recognition datasets (e.g., FER2013, AffectNet).

2)Continuous Monitoring Track individuals over time using facial tracking or person re-identification to assess emotional consistency. A threshold duration (e.g., 5‚Äì10 minutes of persistent sadness) is used to confirm distress.

3)Contextual Categorization Distinguish between controlled environments (schools, offices) and public spaces to tailor the response method accordingly.

Privacy-First Design Ensure that no sensitive personal data (e.g., phone numbers, ID numbers) is collected or stored. All decisions are made using anonymous or location-based identifiers.

üí° SOLUTION

Our solution enables emotion-aware interventions in two distinct environments:
üè´ In Schools and Offices:
Each individual is linked to a seat number, ID badge, or access zone within the environment and a database storing the faces of all students for easy contact

If sadness is detected continuously for 5‚Äì10 minutes, a private alert is sent to the school counselor or HR/management.

The response team can reach out to the person and offer mental health support without delay.

No personally identifiable information is required beyond internal system IDs.

All interactions remain anonymous and non-intrusive, prioritizing emotional well-being while preserving dignity and privacy.
