# **Rooted in Emotion, Branching into Insights**

Introducing our project, Bhav-chitran — a transformative solution in the field of mental health support. We aim to address the delays in traditional psychiatric and counseling services by providing early-stage assistance and effective interventions to targeted users.

Bhav-Chitran (भाव चित्रण) is an innovative emotion detection system that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to interpret and visualize human emotions with depth and sensitivity. Inspired by the rich Indian tradition of understanding "bhav" (emotions), our project combines advanced deep learning techniques with a culturally resonant approach to uncover the intricate layers of human expression. Like a tree with roots deep in emotional intelligence and branches vibrant with diverse feelings, Bhav-Chitran aims to foster a deeper connection between technology and the human experience.

# **Problem Statement**

Turning CCTV into silent guardians of mental health. Mental health crises don’t wait. Yet, in schools, offices, and public spaces, sadness often slips through unnoticed — even under the constant gaze of surveillance cameras. Today's systems see motion, not emotion. The challenge? Build tech that detects emotional distress in real time, connects people to support systems without breaching their privacy, and turns passive monitoring into proactive care.

# **Approach**

We aim to enhance traditional CCTV systems with the capability to detect emotional distress, particularly sadness, and trigger timely, appropriate responses — all while respecting privacy and context.
1)Emotion Detection Use real-time video feeds from existing CCTV cameras to detect facial expressions using computer vision and deep learning models trained on emotion recognition datasets (e.g., FER2013, AffectNet).

2)Continuous Monitoring Track individuals over time using facial tracking or person re-identification to assess emotional consistency. A threshold duration (e.g., 5–10 minutes of persistent sadness) is used to confirm distress.

3)Contextual Categorization Distinguish between controlled environments (schools, offices) and public spaces to tailor the response method accordingly.

Privacy-First Design Ensure that no sensitive personal data (e.g., phone numbers, ID numbers) is collected or stored. All decisions are made using anonymous or location-based identifiers.

# **Solution**

Our solution enables emotion-aware interventions in two distinct environments:

In Schools and Offices:
Each individual is linked to a seat number, ID badge, or access zone within the environment and a database storing the faces of all students or employee for easy contact.

* If sadness is detected continuously for 5–10 minutes, a private alert is sent to the school counselor or HR/management.
  
* The response team can reach out to the person and offer mental health support without delay.
  
* No personally identifiable information is required beyond internal system IDs.
  
* All interactions remain anonymous and non-intrusive, prioritizing emotional well-being while preserving dignity and privacy.

# **Conclusion**
Bhav-Chitran represents a meaningful fusion of technology and cultural insight, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and human emotions. By leveraging deep learning to detect and interpret emotions, this project not only advances the field of emotional intelligence but also honors the Indian concept of "bhav" through its innovative approach. As we continue to refine and expand Bhav-Chitran, we envision a future where technology can empathetically understand and respond to human feelings, creating impactful solutions for mental health support.
